# Designing and planning a cloud solution architecture


designing a cloud architecture involves designing a solution that meets technical and business requirements, designing network, storage and compute resources, creating a migration plan (from on-premises to cloud, or from a cloud provider to another, or from an architecture to another), and envisioning future solution imporvements.  
assessment is the process of understanding what the current situation is like.

- each elem of the existing architecture needs to be replaced by an equivalent or better element in the new architecture

- lift and shift : migration strategy where an organization moves its existing on-premises applications and workloads to the cloud with minimal modification. Instead of redesigning or rearchitecting applications to take full advantage of cloud-native features, the organization essentially lifts its applications from their current environment and shifts them to the cloud infrastructure, often without significant changes to the application code or architecture.

- when choosing which service to use for a particular use case proceed by elimination, use a decision-flow diagram to evaluate the solutions that meet the business and technical requirements.
