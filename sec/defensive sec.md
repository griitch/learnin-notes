2 main tasks :

- preventing intrusions from happening
- detecting intrusions when they happen and responding accordingly

They might also be responsible for some tasks such as :

- training users about cyber security best practices
- documenting and managing assets (types of systems and devices and the software running on them)
- updating and patching systems
- setting up preventative security devices such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems
- setting up logging and monitoring devices.

## Security operations centers aka SOC

A team of cyber sec pros that monitor the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber sec events.
some of their areas of interest are :

- vulnerabilities : when detected, patches and updates must be done, if not available, necessary measures should be taken
- policy violations : security policy is the set of rules required for the protection of the network and should not be violated.
- unauthorized activity
- network intrusion

### Threat intelligence

Info gathered about potential and actual adversaries. Info is collected to help prepare for potential attacks, this is known as threat-informed defense.
Data is collected, processed and analyzed.
Learning about your adversaries allows you to know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary), predict their activity, and consequently, we will be able to mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.

### DFIR digital forensics and incident response

- digital forensics : trying to establish facts about an attack by analyzing the low levels of system memory, the file system, system logs, and network logs.

- incident response
  An incident usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation.  
  the 4 major phases of incident response are :
  - preparation : various measures put in place to prevent incidents happening in the first place
  - detection and analysis : analyse any detected incident to determine its severity
  - containment, eradication and recovery : prevent the incident from propagating to other systems, get rid of it, and try to recover whatever damage it has done
  - post-incident activity : after successful recovery, a report is written and the lessons are shared to prevent similar future incidents.

### Malware analysis

- static analysis : inspecting the program without running it, just reading the disassembled binary and trying to figure out info
- dynamic analysis : running the malware in a sandbox and monitoring its activities.
