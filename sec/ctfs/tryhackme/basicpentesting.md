- to connect to a smb share use smbclient
- to enumerate stuff about smb such as users and password policies etc.. use enum4linux
- to brute force ssh login use hydra
```shell

hydra -l username -P passwordlist ip ssh 

```

- when i found the private rsa key for the second user, i could not connect right away with ssh as they were asking for the key passphrase, but john has a py script called ssh2john that extracts the hash out of a private key, the has will be then fed into john to crack the pass phrase
```shell
python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kaypk > forjohn
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt forjohn
```
- again, privesc does not necessarily means getting a root shell, in this ctf only a shell to a regular user was enough

- how to solve:
  - this is basically a brute forcing ctf, to solve, 
  - first find a username using smb enumeration
  - then brute force the ssh login using hydra
  - then look for a way to escalate the privilege
  - then brute force the rsa private key passphrase
