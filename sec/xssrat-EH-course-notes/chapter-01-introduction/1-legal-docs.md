**Document of engagement :** describing when we will be attacking and from what IP address(es)

**Test plan :** which assets are in/out of scope, what we will test for, how long we expect this to last, what steps we will perform to clean up after ourselves, how we will retain access if we gain it, and what tools we will be using. Finally, I always recommend configuring burp to add an extra header that indicates your name and that you are doing an approved pentest. This will make it easier to filter out your logging

**Test report :** we should describe all our findings in detail including severity, ease of exploitability, description, Steps to reproduce, actual result, expected result, IPs and accounts you used, cleanup steps, and what you did to retain access after the hack if applicable

**Final signoff :** This is a very simple and short document in which the customer confirms they received all of the deliverables.

**the docs above are required for pentesters only, the docs below are required for both pentsters and bug bounty hunter**

**NDA** : non disclosure agreement signed before hacking, contains terms and conditions to respect.

**Application/agreement** : Sometimes you will have to apply to a bug bounty program to be allowed to test on it

**Insurance** : necessary in case something went wrong
