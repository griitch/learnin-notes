# Hash functions

### Security properties
- preimage resistance :  given an element in the range of a hash function, it should be computationally infeasible to find an input that maps to that element, just a fancy way to say a one-way func
- second preimage resistance : the property of a hash function that it is computationally infeasible to find any second input that has the same output as a given input, AKA collision resistant
