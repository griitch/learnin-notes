#Atomic habits

## Chapter 1 : the fundamentals

Tiny changes play a big role, and their effect is barely noticeable at the moment, but the accumulation of multiple tiny changes will be.  
The effects of habits won't be noticeable right away, and that goes for bad and good habits, eating tacos will not make you fatter right away, going to the gym for a week won't make you stronger.  
The difference will be noticeable after reaching a certain threshold.  
You should not be goal-oriented, instead of focusing on the end result itself, focus on the process you need to follow in order to reach the result. eg : instead of setting working at a FAANG company as a goal, focus on the system you will follow to work for them, solving algorithmic challenges, learning system design, practicing behavioral interviews etc... The focus should be on this system, how to optimize it and be better at it, the result will come by itself eventually.

Cue -> craving -> response -> reward is the pattern of every habit

## Chapter 2 : The first law, make it obvious

Things that we've done over and over will become sort of done automatically, aka sub-consciously, without thinking.

Our brain tend to associate visual cues to sub-conscious actions.

A good exercise is starting a habits scoreboard, in which we list things we do unconsciously, to stay aware of the habits we already have and we seem to overlook.

The most effective cues for habits are time and location, and to leverage both of them try to make a plan that involves them when trying to form a new habit : `at time x, and place y, i will do z`

Another method is habit stacking, which goes like `after [current habit] i will [habit im trying to develop]`

If you trying to use a visual cue for your habits, try to make it obvious and a big part of your environment.

## Chapter 3 : make it attractive

Dopamine is the reason we get hooked on stuff, it gets released whenever we feel some sort of pleasure, `but also when we anticipate it`, it's the reason behind motivation and desire...

We tend to do imitate the habits of 3 sort of people : the close (family friends), the many (the tribe), the powerful (w status and prestige)

We do things that are deemed by our culture/environment to be the norm, in my 2nd highschool year i was surrounded by dumb mfs, so i became a dumb mf too, but in the 3rd year it was the opposite, the takeaway from this is that in order to develop a habit u need to put yourself in an environment/culture where that habit is accepted and is the norm. And if u wanna remove a bad habit, consider changing the environment, crackheads hang out with other crackheads, and that's what make them keep doing crack

any sort of desire is a manifestation of our primitive cravings of survival, reproducing...

To make a habit attractive we need to associate it with an enjoyable experience, we need to do something we enjoy immediately before a hard habit, the reward that you will get will make you come back to that habit once again, and with repetition it will become automatic

## Chapter 4 : make it easy

taking action is preferred over being in motion, what the author means by being in motion is planning and strategizing without actually making any action, exactly like me writing lists of technologies and things i want to learn and projects i want to make and books i want to read without ever starting any of them.

Actions are behavior with a noticeable outcome

The time to form a new habit is irrelevant compared to the number of repetitions one should do before the habit becomes automatic, wether it's 2 years or 10 years does not matter, what does matter is the frequency of practice.

The practice repetitions to form a habit will be numerous, and thats why they should be easy.

Humans are inherently lazy, when given the choice between 2 actions, they will perform the one that requires less energy.

To make a habit easier, reduce the friction and intermediary steps to perform it, and inversely, increase it to drop a bad habit, example in the book : to stop watching tv excessively,remove batteries of the tv remote, and unplug the tv, and remove it from the room when done watching, there will be too many things to do when you will want to watch tv again to the point that you'll just pass.

To avoid being overwhelmed when trying to pick up a new habit, it should not take more than 2 mins to be done,in the beginning, as time goes on, the 2 mins will become the starting point of a habit that takes longer to complete.

Technology and automation should be used as much as possible in your favor to build good habits and get rid of bad ones.

## Chapter 5 : make it satisfying

Humans are more into instant gratification than they are into delayed gratification, examples : people know that cigarettes are bad for health but they still smoke because the reward they get puffing a cigarette is instant, while the health problems are delayed. Going to the gym : people leave the gym after the first month because they don't notice the result right away, even though they know that it will come with time.

Habits that are immediately followed by a reward are repeated

The best way to keep a habit is by using a visual progress tracker, by seeing it, you will get this urge to keep the streak going

## Chapter 6 : advanced tactics

not all people are born the same, some people are built have certain characteristics that make them more suitable for certain tasks. Same goes for habit, it will be hard to pick up a habit that is usually associated with people that are different from you personality and physicality wise.
