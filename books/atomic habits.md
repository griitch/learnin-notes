#Atomic habits

## Chapter 1 : the fundamentals

Tiny changes play a big role, and their effect is barely noticeable at the moment, but the accumulation of multiple tiny changes will be.  
The effects of habits won't be noticeable right away, and that goes for bad and good habits, eating tacos will not make you fatter right away, going to the gym for a week won't make you stronger.  
The difference will be noticeable after reaching a certain treshold.  
You should not be goal-oriented, instead of focusing on the end result itself, focus on the process you need to follow in order to reach the result. eg : instead of setting working at a faang company as a goal, focus on the system you will follow to work for them, solving algorithmic challenges, learning system design, practicing behavioral interviews etc... The focus should be on this system, how to optimize it and be better at it, the result will come by itself eventually.

## Chapter 2 : The first law, make it obvious

Things that we've done over and over will become sort of done automatically, aka sub-consciously, without thinking.
Our brain tend to associate visual cues to sub-conscious actions.  
A good exercice is starting a habits scoreboard, in which we list things we do unconsciously, to stay aware of the habits we already have and we seem to overlook.  
The most effective cues for habits are time and location, and to leverage both of them try to make a plan that involes them when trying to form a new habit : `at time x, and place y, i will do z`  
Another method is habit stacking, which goes like `after [current habbit] i will [habit im trying to develop]`  
If you trying to use a visual cue for your habits, try to make it obvious and a big part of your environment.
