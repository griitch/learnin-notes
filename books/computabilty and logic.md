# Computabilty and Logic - George Boolos, John P. Burgess

## Enumerability
a set S is said to be enumerable aka countable if it exists a function f such as that, for each s in S, there is an integer N such as f(n) = s,N represent *Nth* element of the set 
### Examples
- the set of all integer numbers f = x => x 
- the set of even numbers : f = x => 2*x
- the set of odd numbers : f => x => 2*x + 1


## Diagonalization
Not all sets are enumerable, check Cantor's theorem that states that the set of all sets of positive ints is not enumerable.

## Turing machines
The state of a turing machine : i always thought that it was the current value of the cell of the tape, but it's not, the state is defined through transition rules
