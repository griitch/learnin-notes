    //object : used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities 
    //compared to primitive types

    //let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax (NOT RECCOMENDED USE OBJ LITERALS INSTEAD )
    let user = { name: "john doe", age: 45, isRetarded: true, saysomethng: function () { ; } };  // "object literal" syntax
    //the last property can be followed by a comma

    //to add a property / attribute
    user.nickname = "goo";
    user["omar yaya"] = "gritch";



    //to remove a property
    delete user.nickname;
    delete user["omar yaya"]
    // console.log(user["omar yaya"] or user.nickname) => undefined

    //computed properties are inside square brackets [], they mean that the name of the prop
    //should be computed from the value

    //let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
    let fruit = "apple";
    let bag = { [fruit]: 5, }; // the name of the property is taken from the variable fruit
    // equivalent to let bag = { "apple": 5,}

    //works the same as 
    // fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?", "apple");
    bag = {};
    bag[fruit] = 5;

    //there are no limitations on property names. They can be any strings or symbols
    //except from the __proto__ property

    let obj = { 0: "okay" }; //same as "0" : "okay"
    //numbers are converted to strings
    //obj[0] and obj["0"] are the same


    //contrairement à d'autres languages de prog ,l'accès à un attribut d'un objet javascript
    //qui n'existe pas ne génére pas d'erreur, il retourne "undefinded"

    //to check if a property exists or no use the "in" operator
    ("name" in user) //returns true

    // !("key" in object) is the same as (object.key === undefined) but there is a case where the latter does not
    //work as intended, its where the property exists but stores an undefined


    //the for in loop
    obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2", key3: "value3" }
    for (key in obj) {
      console.log(key) // gives key i 
      console.log(obj[key])// returns value i 
      //i = { 1,2,3 }
    }

    //are objects ordered ? if we loop thru an object with for in loop will it process the properties
    //in the same way they were added ?
    //for integer properties, they are sorted, for other types, they appear in creation order
    let codes = {
      "49": "Germany",
      "41": "Switzerland",
      "44": "Great Britain",
      // ..,
      "1": "USA"
    };

    for (let code in codes) {
      //alert(code); // 1, 41, 44, 49
    }

    // call bind and apply

    let objet = { num: 17 }
    function useNum(a) { return this.num + a; }

    //objet does not have a method useNum but we can do this, temporarily attach the method to the obj and execute it
    useNum.call(objet, 5);

    useNum.apply(object, [5]) //pretty much the same thing as call but uses an array for args

    var boundFunction = useNum.bind(objet);
    // the bound function has the same body as the og func except the "this" of the param obj is bound to it
    boundFunction(5) // works fine
