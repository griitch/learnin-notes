# Ethical hacking rules

- When you come across a vulnerability, I expect you to disclose it responsibly. Do not make a blog post detailing the full issue and target or anything that can lead back to your discovery.

- Personal data is sacred, do not leak ANY personal information.

- We are here to help others, not destroy them. Do not use any of this information in a malicious way.

- When you get a foothold on a server in production, do NOT attempt to perform priv esc, this might break the server or have unexpected consequences. Instead, report the issue responsibly and donâ€™t leak it.

- Do not take on the task when someone comes to you with an offer that is shady or seems in the gray area. It might be someone taking revenge and tricking you and besides, gray area tasks are usually riddled with the betrayal of people not paying each other.

- Do NOT test any target without permission

boundaries that should not be crossed : personal information + money.  
As soon as they're crossed the test stops being ethical
