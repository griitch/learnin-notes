# Definition

Forensics mean the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts. digital forensics is the branch that deals with the investigation of computer related crimes.  
Some of the questions it answers :

- how to collect and transfer digital evidence such as laptops/smartphones, what are the procedures to follow if the laptop/smartphone is running
- how to analyze te collected digital evidence..  
  There are 2 types of digital forensics investigations :
- **public sector investigation** : carried by law or gov agencies, they would be part of a crime or civil investigation
- **private sector investigation** : carried by corporate bodies by assigning a private investigator, whether in-house or outsourced, they are triggered by corporate policy violation.

# The process

### Acquire the evidence :

Collect all the laptops, phones, storage devices, cameras.. (pcs require special handling if they were turned on)

### Establish a chain of custody

By filling out a form that contains 2 tables, the first is for listing all the evidence found in the scene, it got 3 columns, an item id its quantity, and a description, the 2nd table the chain of custody that lists when an item have been transferred and from who to who, it got 6 columns, the item id, date/time of transfer, the person who released it (signed), the person who received it, location and optional comments

### Place the evidence in a secure container.

To ensure it does not get damaged, and that devices that can access a network don't get wiped out remotely.

### Transport to the forensics labs

the process at the lab goes like : - create a forensic copy of the evidence - the copies are validated with hashes. - return the evidence to the secure container (if we damage the copy we can always create a new copy) - process the copy on the forensics workstation - reporting
