# stuff i learnt

- For hacking web apps, the first thing to do is inspect the source of the page, you might find hidden infos there.
- Use dirb or gobuster with a good wordlist such as common.txt
- a lot of the stuff in the ctf is a sort of bait, it's useless and you won't need it but it's there to waste your time
